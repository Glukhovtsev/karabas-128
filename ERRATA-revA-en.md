# ERRATA for PCB rev.A:

1) LM2596S has been a bit improperly routed, so there are a bit of noise. Possibly fixes: solder capacitors as close as possible to the unit.

2) It is better to power PAL coder via noise filter, so you need to cut one of the 5V track that power AD724 and put a ferrite bead or inductor + a ceramic and electrolytic caps to it as close as possible

3) MiniDin8 for RGB output has a mirrored layout
